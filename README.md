## Introduction

This project provides a basic implementation of a Trie data structure in Java. A Trie is a tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Tries are particularly efficient for tasks involving dynamic sets and when there is a natural hierarchy in the keys, such as with strings.

## Features

- Insertion of keys into the Trie.
- Searching for keys in the Trie.

## Getting Started

### Usage

Clone the repository and compile the Java code:

```bash
javac Trie.java
```

Run the example:

```bash
java Trie
```

This will demonstrate basic Trie operations.
